Description: Provides analytical tools for investigating acclimation and 
    adaptation mechanisms in forest tree holobionts, with focus on Quercus 
    robur. Functions support analysis of multi-omics data (genomics, 
    epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) integrated with physiological, 
    morphological, and environmental measurements from controlled experiments 
    and field monitoring. Includes tools for processing microclimatic data, 
    analyzing stress gradients (drought, herbivory), and linking environmental 
    variation to holobiont responses across spatial scales. Designed for the 
    PhytOakmeter research unit studying tree responses across environmental 
    gradients from ecotron to pan-European scales.
